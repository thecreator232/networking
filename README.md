# networking-and-go


## What ?

I'm creating this repo to write down notes that I take while I read TCP/IP and other books related to networking.

## Why ?

I've always been interested in learning things related to networking and how things work, this is one of the many attempts of doing the same. Hopefully this may come to my use some day, or someone else.
